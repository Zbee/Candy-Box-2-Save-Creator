#Candy Box 2 Save Creator
This little program will generate saves for use in Candy Box 2.

##Todo
- Interface in Bootstrap
- Generator in Javascript
- Verifier in Javascript

##How to use
Open up the program and select all of the options you want for your save and generate it.
It'll just take a moment to generate and then be verified and will then return a blob of text for you.
You can take this text to [Candy Box 2](http://candybox2.net/), unlock developer features until you see the save button in the bar at the top of the screen, and then scroll down in the save screen to the loading section, and in the text load subsection paste your text and you'll be at your selected point in the game.
